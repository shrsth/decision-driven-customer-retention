# Decision-Driven Customer Retention System

A decision-first customer retention system that converts churn predictions into economically justified actions under budget and operational constraints, and validates decision robustness before deployment.

> **Key idea:** Models do not create value. Decisions do.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This is **not** a churn prediction dashboard.

It is a **decision-driven retention system** that:
- Predicts customer churn probability
- Quantifies economic impact (CLV, retention cost, net retention value)
- Prioritizes customers based on **economic efficiency**
- Enforces real-world constraints (budget + operational capacity)
- Outputs **ACT / MONITOR / IGNORE** decisions
- Explains *why* each decision was made
- Tests decision stability under changing constraints

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Most churn projects stop at:
- “Here is the churn probability”
- “Here is a dashboard”

Real retention teams need answers to:
- Who should we act on right now?
- Is this action worth the cost?
- What happens if our budget or capacity changes?
- Are these decisions stable enough to deploy?

This project explicitly answers those questions.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (Tiered by Design)
app/
├── core.py # Tier 1: Pure decision engine (NO Streamlit)
├── analysis.py # Tier 2/3: Strategy comparison & robustness testing
└── dashboard.py # Streamlit UI (simulation layer only)

├── models/ # Logistic regression churn model
├── decision/ # Strategy & constraint logic
└── tests/ # Unit tests for decision correctness


### Why tier separation matters
- Decision logic is framework-agnostic
- Can be deployed as a backend service
- UI is replaceable without touching core logic

## ⚙️ Decision Framework

1. **Churn prediction**  
   Logistic Regression is used strictly as a risk signal.

2. **Economic modeling**
   - Revenue at risk = churn_probability × CLV
   - Net retention value = revenue at risk − retention cost

3. **Prioritization**
   Customers are ranked by economic efficiency:
   efficiency = net_retention_value / retention_cost

4. **Strategy layer**
Business posture is applied:
- Conservative
- Balanced
- Aggressive

5. **Constraints**
- Retention budget
- Maximum number of customers that can be handled

6. **Final actions**
- ACT
- MONITOR
- IGNORE

Only customers with positive net retention value are eligible for action.

## 📊 Decision Robustness & Safety

Before deployment, the system validates:

- Stability under ±10% budget changes
- Stability under ±10% capacity changes
- Boundary customers sensitive to strategy shifts
- Counterfactual differences across strategies

High stability indicates the system is **safe to operate in real-world conditions**.

---

## 🧪 Key Design Choices

- **Logistic Regression** chosen for interpretability and stability  
- **Greedy, constraint-aware selection** for determinism and auditability  
- **Risk bands** represent operational urgency, not statistical confidence  
- **No end-to-end deep learning**, prioritizing decision clarity over model complexity  

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Purpose

The Streamlit dashboard is **not for EDA**.

It exists to:
- Simulate real retention decisions
- Compare strategies under identical constraints
- Communicate decisions to non-technical stakeholders
- Demonstrate system robustness visually

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app/dashboard.py
